# ✨ Hi there! I'm ValleyDragon! ✨
I'm a software developer from the UK with an interest in game development.

**Frameworks**: macroquad.rs, pygame-ce

**Interesting things:**
- I really like the syntax of Kotlin, but I hate using it because of the smoking pile of 💩🤬 that is Gradle.
- The best game framework for syntax is Pygame-ce. The only problem is no web 🕸️ support ☹️. (sortof)
- I'm also into 3d printing and electronics.

**Hot takes 🔥**
- Gradle sucks. (This isn't really a hot take).
- Gradle reallly sucks.
- I can't think of any more hot takes.

At the moment, I'm:
- Staying away from Kotlin/Gradle (Rant beginning...)
- Wishing I was running Linux like I used to. ☹️
- Attempting to remove bloatware (ahem, AI) from Windows
- Making a crazy-golf inspired godot game with a friend.

[I would note that although this says javascript as being significant, I have never written a line in my life. This all comes from several MASSIVE files that the developer of macroquad wrote to load wasm into the browser]
