# ✨ Hi there! I'm ValleyDragon! ✨
I'm a software developer from the UK with an interest in game development.

**Interesting things:**
- I really like the syntax of Kotlin, but I hate using it because of the smoking pile of 💩🤬 that is Gradle.
- The best game framework for syntax is Pygame-ce. The only problem is no web 🕸️ support ☹️.
- I'm also into 3d printing and electronics.

**Hot takes 🔥**
- Gradle sucks. (This isn't really a hot take).
- Gradle reallly sucks.

At the moment, I'm:
- Staying away from Kotlin/Gradle
- Wishing I was running Linux like I used to.
- Making a crazy-golf inspired godot game with a friend.
